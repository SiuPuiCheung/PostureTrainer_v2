# Project Brief: Next-Gen Fitness Posture Trainer MVP

## Objective
Deliver a desktop-first, privacy-centric posture trainer that provides accurate, explainable, and engaging guidance for individuals, with a clear path to a professional coach tier. The MVP prioritizes edge processing (MediaPipe) for real-time feedback, and optional deep analysis (YOLOv11) for recorded sessions. The product will be cross-platform (desktop, mobile, and web), with a desktop-first design approach while maintaining parity across mobile and web for core features. Australia-focused compliance and market fit guide early launch.

## MVP: Minimum Viable Product
The MVP focuses on delivering core value quickly with measurable acceptance criteria. It must be simple to use, privacy-first, and provide accurate, actionable feedback for common exercises.

In-scope (MVP deliverables):
- Live posture detection (desktop/webcam) using MediaPipe; real-time overlay skeleton and confidence indicators.
- Camera setup wizard (placement, lighting, framing) with visual prompts and gating to ensure reliable capture.
- Core exercise support: Squat, Push-up, Lunge (expandable); per-rep scoring and per-session summary.
- Basic coaching feedback: short, actionable textual tips; initial TTS support optional.
- Local session summaries (JSON) with minimal analytics: per-step avg angle deviation, confidence, timestamps.
- Local-first privacy model with explicit biometric consent screen and easy data deletion.
- Simple single-user UI: run session, view summary, and export JSON.
- Simple gamification: form score, streak counter, and a minimal confidence overlay to encourage correct setup.

Acceptance Criteria (MVP):
- Detection: Pose landmarks available at ≥10 FPS on target desktop hardware for the chosen exercises.
- Accuracy: Per-exercise average angle deviation within an acceptable range during bench tests (e.g., <15° mean deviation for core joints on test users).
- Usability: Camera setup wizard reduces capture errors in 80% of test cases during onboarding.
- Privacy: All processing defaults to local; any cloud sync must be opt‑in with explicit consent.

Out-of-scope for MVP (Phase 2+):
- Live YOLOv11 deep inference on-device (server-side only when offered as optional deep analysis).
- Full multi-user coach dashboards and sharing workflows.
- Advanced sequence builder and auto key-pose extraction (Phase 2).
- Extensive mobile‑optimized features and native mobile apps (lightweight mobile support in MVP; full native apps in Phase 2).

Metrics to track during MVP:
- Weekly Active Users (WAU)
- Session completion rate
- Advice confirmation rate (did the user accept/retry the recommended action?)
- Average per-step angle deviation improvements across users
- Key capture failures from setup wizard (used to improve onboarding)

- Real-time posture analysis via webcam (desktop-first), optional upload for batch review; simplified live capture for mobile and browser-based capture for web.
- Pose detection: MediaPipe for live feedback; optional YOLOv11 for “Deep Analysis” on saved sets.
- Coaching feedback: concise text prompts; voice/TTS optional.
- UI: overlay skeleton, green/red zones, setup wizard for camera placement and lighting.
- Session summaries: local JSON metrics, simple charts; export optional.
- Gamification: form score (0–100), streaks, top issues per session.
- Privacy: local processing by default; explicit consent for any cloud sync. Platform parity: ensure consistent privacy controls across desktop, mobile, and web interfaces.

- Phase 1 (Individuals): live posture checks, basic analytics, local summaries; desktop-first launch with concurrent light-weight mobile and web capture support for core scenarios.
- Phase 2 (Engagement & Customization): sequence builder (kata/dance/rehab flows), key‑pose extraction, trend analytics, gamification.
- Phase 3 (Coach Pro Tier): multi‑client dashboard, role‑based access, history repository, template sharing (local or encrypted).
- Phase 4 (Expansion): ergonomic/corporate modules, public API, optional cloud sync.

- Edge‑first pipeline: MediaPipe on device for low latency and zero cloud inference cost; use TF.js/ONNX/WebAssembly builds for browser inference where practical.
- Hybrid analysis: optional YOLOv11 deep analysis (background task or server-side only on demand) and mobile-optimized variants for constrained devices.
- Storage: Local‑first; if cloud needed, use zero‑egress object storage (e.g., Cloudflare R2) for cost control, and provide cross‑platform sync (opt‑in) so sessions and templates are available on desktop, mobile, and web.
- Modular design: plug‑in models and metrics; REST API for integrations.
- Multi‑user readiness: designed for future coach/enterprise tiers.

-## Custom Routines & Key‑Pose Extraction (Phase 2)
- Automated key‑pose extraction: velocity + dwell heuristics, optional clustering.
- Tolerances from intra‑window angle variance; symmetry/balance metrics.
- Routine JSON schema: steps with labels, key angles, timing, tolerances, metadata.
- Alignment methods: minimal DTW with tolerance gating for post‑session scoring; real‑time heuristics for live guidance. Consider platform-specific fallbacks: lower-dimensional angle sets or sparser sampling on mobile/web to reduce latency while preserving fairness.
- Human‑in‑loop: timeline editor to merge/split steps, relabel, adjust tolerances.

## Analytics & Reporting
- Core metrics: per‑step angle deviation, timing offset, symmetry index, posture alignment score, confidence/visibility.
- Session summaries: ranked issues list, flow score, improvement trends.
- Export: JSON summaries; later CSV/PDF for coaches.

## Market & Differentiation (Australia)
- Gap: few desktop/web tools combine CV precision, customizable multi‑step routines, and conversational coaching.
- Differentiators: accuracy, explainability, local privacy, coach workflow integration.
- Go‑to‑market: niche communities (martial arts, home fitness), early coach cohort, transparent dev blog.

## Compliance & Privacy (AU)
- Positioning: “fitness & wellness guidance” (avoid clinical claims); comply with TGA SaMD exclusions.
- Sensitive data: treat skeletal templates as sensitive; explicit consent; easy delete; local processing by default.
- Security: encrypt any cloud data; provide user controls for retention and sharing.

## Monetization & Business Model
- Phase 1: free core; donation link.
- Phase 2: individual premium (analytics, sequences).
- Phase 3: coach tier (multi‑client dashboard, sharing).
- No ads in MVP; focus on value and retention.

## Technical Considerations
- Accuracy vs latency: MediaPipe for live, YOLOv11 for deep review; quantization where needed.
- Low‑resource mode for older hardware (reduced FPS/features).
- Resource‑efficient LLM prompts for feedback; optional offline heuristics.
- Simple onboarding: setup wizard for placement/lighting; confidence thresholds to prevent “hallucinated” advice.

## Success Criteria (Early KPIs)
- Engagement: weekly active users, session duration, streak retention.
- Quality: advice confirmation rate, average angle deviation reduction over time.
- Differentiation: sequence builder adoption (Phase 2), coach cohort activation (Phase 3).

## Summary
Start lean: accurate real‑time guidance with transparent, actionable feedback and local privacy. Build differentiation through explainable metrics and customizable sequences, then expand into a coach‑centric workflow for sustainable monetization.
